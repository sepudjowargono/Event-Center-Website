## 🏁 Introduction
This multi-page website was created as part of a web development project focused on building a realistic Event Center experience.  

The platform represents **StardXm Athletics**, a sports organization offering volleyball leagues and community programs. This project demonstrates:

- Semantic HTML structure  
- CSS layout systems (Flexbox, responsive design)  
- Event schedule table
- Contact form
- Navigation across multiple pages  
- Interactive elements (hover effects, buttons, CTA sections)  
- Consistent design theme and branding  

By completing this project, I created a portfolio-ready website that reflects real-world design decisions and client-oriented thinking.
